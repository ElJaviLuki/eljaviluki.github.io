    "intro": "Driven by innate curiosity and a hands-on approach, I turn complex needs into simple yet effective full-stack software solutions that deliver tangible results.",
    "storyTitle": "My Story & Philosophy",
    "storyParagraph1": "Since childhood, I've been fascinated by technology and the 'how' of things. But my interest doesn't stop at understanding; I constantly ask myself, 'How could this be *better*?'. This duality defines my work: I possess an intuitive ability—influenced by my father's intuition—that allows me to perceive underlying needs and visualize creative solutions, almost like a sixth sense for potential.",
    "storyMediaAlt1": "Visualization of intuition or potential",
    "storyParagraph2": "However, I understand that even the most brilliant ideas are worthless if they aren't practical and communicable—a crucial lesson inherited from my mother's characteristic pragmatism. That's why I always anchor that vision in practicality: seeking tangible results, defining clear steps, and building solutions that people can actually use, here and now. This ability to balance future vision with immediate, real-world utility is central to my approach.",
    "storyMediaAlt2": "Visualization of pragmatism or practical application",
    "storyParagraph3": "My goal is to merge these two facets: vision and pragmatism.",
    "caseStudyTitle": "A Real Case:",
    "caseStudyParagraph1": "One example is the custom ERP built for Ortoprodent. This dental lab is renowned for the quality of its prosthetics and the skill of its team. However, like many specialized businesses, its administrative management posed significant challenges, consuming valuable time and energy. Anticipating that commercial software would be too complex for their specific needs, I opted for a pragmatic approach, built from scratch. The priority was an exceptionally user-friendly experience (minimal cognitive load), with highly optimized workflows and a clean interface. The result? A tool that not only organizes but truly smooths the friction of management, allowing the team to dedicate all their talent to what they do best: creating exceptional prosthetic work.",
    "caseStudyMediaAlt": "Visualization of the dental lab ERP project",
    "approachTitle": "My Approach: From Need to Solution",
    "approachStep1Title": "360° Diagnosis",
    "approachStep1Desc": "Deep-dive into the core challenge, connecting human needs and business goals with technical feasibility to define the fundamental 'what' and 'why'.",
    "approachStep2Title": "Vision & Design",
    "approachStep2Desc": "Fuse creative vision with pragmatic design: architect the solution and define the optimal user experience, charting a clear path to the desired outcome.",
    "approachStep3Title": "Real Impact",
    "approachStep3Desc": "Bring the solution to life: build functional, robust software that solves the identified challenge, delivering measurable value and improving the experience for everyone involved."
